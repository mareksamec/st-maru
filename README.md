My build of st (stimple terminal by suckless)
https://st.suckless.org/


WORK IN PROGRESS

## Info
This simple build is based on st version 0.8.4 (original version can be downloaded here from the official suckless website https://dl.suckless.org/st/st-0.8.4.tar.gz )

These st patches are included in the build for convenience:

- **vertcenter** - Just a cosmetic change to vertically center lines if larger chscale is set in config (https://st.suckless.org/patches/vertcenter/)
- **keyboard-select** - enabled urxvt like keyboard selection in the terminal
- **st-font2** - Allows settings of the second font in config.h (for special characters in airline/powerline or emoji)
- **scrollback** - Enables scrollback in suckless terminal.

## TODO:
Add keyboard shortcuts description
